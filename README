Roboconfessional @ Noisebridge
------------------------------

A robo-priest - THX1138-inspired - will tell you stories about Noisebridge and its discontents.
It will hear your confessions as well and share with the Internets. Tell it your sins. 

- This project was created to comment on political affairs involving hackerspaces, makerspaces, 
and their sources and plans for the future.

- Depends on python-gst, gtk, and gstreamer0.10
